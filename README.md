# Synthetic Datastream Database Generator
This project is a Streamlit app that allows you to generate a synthetic datastream database. The app provides an interactive interface where you can select:

- **Drift Type**: Abrupt, Gradual or Incremental drift.
- **Stream size**: Number of bits at data stream
- **Samples**: Stream samples.
- **% Maximum Duration**: Max Drift duration based at stream size.
- **Division**: Aplitude. 

Also, it could be generated randomly, using the random tab at streamlit app.

The generated data can be exported in CSV format for further use.
